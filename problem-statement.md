# Problem Statement

**For** Salma, the 27-year-old graphic designer passionate about Tangier’s creative scene, 

**who** struggles to find updated and collaborative platforms that showcase local cultural and digital initiatives,  

**we want** to create an inspiring digital space that highlights Tangier’s richness through stories, events, and community projects,

**so that** she and other locals can discover, share, and promote the city’s creativity in one collaborative platform.

## Proposed MVP Solution (3 simple ideas)
- **Home page:** highlights the latest cultural and digital initiatives in Tangier (articles, events, and artist profiles).
- **Collaborative posting:** allows registered users to share their own content (photos, stories, or local discoveries).
- **Mobile access:** an Android app connected to the Laravel API, making it easy to browse and contribute on the go.

## Success Metric
 - **≥ 70% of users view or interact with at least one local initiative (article, post, or event) within their first session.**

(Measured through interactions such as “likes,” “comments,” or article views recorded via the app or website.)
