# Problem Statement

**For** Ahmed, the 31-year-old marketer who only has a 15-minute lunch break and no gym access,  
**who** loses time on apps that demand long setup or constant internet,  
**we want** an app that instantly offers a ready-to-start 15-minute workout,  
**so that** he can exercise effectively without any friction.

## Proposed MVP Solution (3 simple ideas)
- **Home screen:** 3 pre-made 15-min workouts (push / cardio / stretch) – one tap to start  
- **Offline mode:** workouts downloadable once, usable anywhere (basement, no Wi-Fi)  
- **Live tracker:** shows timer + calories burned during the session

## Success Metric
- **≥ 70 % of users complete a full 15-minute workout on their first launch**  
  (measured via “Finish” button tap after timer ends)
